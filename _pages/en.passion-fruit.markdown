## Flavoury sourness provides a unique taste to desserts.

Passion Fruit is notoriously difficult to deliver overseas when ripe.
Therefore, you won’t find it in every store. The Passion Fruit Pulp is
eaten with a spoon or could be made into juice. which becomes even tastier
if you mix it with orange juice. The pulp is used as a filling for baking,
an addition to cocktails, ice cream, yoghurts and various desserts.

Passion fruit has a high concentration of vitamin A and vitamin B3, and
regarded by many as a natural way of lowering cholesterol. Passion fruit
contains 7 times more vitamin C, 13 times more iron and 5 times more fibre
than an apple. Plus vitamin K and antioxidants.
